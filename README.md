Some analysis of my own data. Ranging from sleep, to performance to bedtime and so on.  

## Sleep Data

In this notebook i'll try to dive deep into my sleep data. Some questions i might try to answer are:
1) Do i sleep consistently? Any bias towards certain months?
2) How good or bad my sleep is? 
3) Can i predict sleep score solely based on night performance? Is it weigheted somehow?
